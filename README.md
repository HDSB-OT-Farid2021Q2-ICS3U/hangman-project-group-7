# Hangman Assignment

## How to Play:
    1.  Access the game via the main.py file.
    
    2. Begin the game by pressing on the green triangle at the top right of the screen.

    3. The game will then choose a word, it is up to you to guess what the word is. All you have is the number of letters in the word, and you'll see where you guesses place in that word. You can guess either a single letter, or the entire word.

    4. You have 6 chances, if you don't guess the correct word within those 6, you lose.

    5. If you do guess the word, the man doesn't get hanged, and you win.

    6. If you wish to play again, please run the program again.

## Reflection:
    We used functions in our program many times, mainly for the win/lose prompts and the hangman drawings. We used functions to reduce the amount of code in the program, as we used the functions multiple times. We also used functions for some ease of use, such as the title function, as it reduced our hassle.

    We are using strings over lists, as it speeds up the program heavily, especially for those who may have a slower computer. They are also easier to work with and have a wider set of built-in functions we can use to better the game.

    We used a seperate word list file, so that people can import their own words. That way, you can customize it in different ways to fit your scenario.

    Our game is for those ages 10 and up, as we feel the game deals with mortality it likely isn't best for very young children. Our game can be sold to people of all varieties, as hangman is a gloabl game, with an easy to understand premise.

    We began by sectioning off the work, the word generator, the drawings and the indexer. From there, we essentially just stuck to our sections, and collaboratively merged our individual work onto one file. We each bug fixed as we saw appropriate, and changed what we thought needed to be changed.
